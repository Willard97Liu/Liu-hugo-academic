Hi! Thank you for visiting my page! I am Willard (刘伟). I graduated from Taiyuan University of Technology in Aug 2020, and now I am a third-year postgraduate student in NWU(Xian), supervised by [Professor Li Chen](https://ist.nwu.edu.cn/info/1017/1269.htm). My research interests are in machine learning and deep learning, and specifically in neural network, multi/many-objective optimization, large-scale optimization and evolutionary transfer optimization.
