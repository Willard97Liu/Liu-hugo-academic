Hi! Thank you for visiting my page! I am Averill (刘伟). I graduated from Taiyuan University of Technology in Aug 2020, and now I am a third-year postgraduate student in NWU(Xi'an), supervised by [Professor Li Chen](https://ist.nwu.edu.cn/info/1017/1269.htm). My research interests are in machine learning, deep learning, data processing, algorithm optimization and specifically in multi/many-objective optimization, large-scale optimization and evolutionary transfer optimization.
