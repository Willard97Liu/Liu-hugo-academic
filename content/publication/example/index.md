abstract: "In large-scale multi-objective problems, the tradi\x02tional
  offspring generation operators is directionless and blind, which leads to the
  low searching capability in a huge search space. For this, we propose a
  two-stage multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, named MOEA-BTS to solve
  large-scale multi-objective problems(LSMOPs). In MOEA-BTS, the offspring
  generation process is divided into two stages. In the early stage, a new
  hybrid of local and global search direction construction method is proposed,
  aiming to balance the exploitation and exploration of the search. In the late
  stage, a series of weight vectors divide the decision space into subspaces,
  where the competitive swarm optimization algorithm is performed for further
  precise optimizations. Experiments are conducted on the LSMOPs with 500 and
  1000 decision variables and results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm
  can perform better than several state-of-the art evolutionary algorithms."
